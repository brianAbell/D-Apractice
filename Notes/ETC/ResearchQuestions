Purpose: Difficulties faced during preparation for technical interviews and what resources are used.

1. How can universities supply the knowledge of Data Structures & Algorithms needed for students to succeed in the preparation for technical interviews?

2. TODO How would supplemental preparation methods such as Blind75 benefit/improve upon current core methods such as Leetcode?
	→ Supplement leetcode instead of replace?
	→ EX: blind75 and Sean Prashads list are underlying patterns found within leetcode problems. They still ARE utilizing leetcode, just in a different way.

3. How has leetcode become a fundamental part of the technical interview preparation phase?

4. What are alternative methods of interview preparation that would alleviate some of the stresses associated with the preparation phase of interviews?

5. Would providing a more structured studying pattern alleviate the current stresses of technical interview preparation?
	→ This is looking to see if structures such as the blind75 are able to help reduce stress in individuals.
