# Technical Interview Research
I will begin my research by conducting a general survey in regards to college student approaches to studying for various technical interviews. Once enough data is collected, I will research the various paths taken and attempt to uncover better approaches which will aid future students. Additionally, any improvement upon current technical interview practices will be noted as well.
